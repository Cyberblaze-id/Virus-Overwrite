**Virus-Overwrite** is a project designed to demonstrate the concept of a self-replicating virus (often called a "computer virus"). This program overwrites the contents of other executable files with its own code, simulating a virus-like behavior for educational purposes. 

## Features
- **Self-replication**: The virus reads its own binary code and injects it into other `.out` files in the current directory.
- **Basic Virus Simulation**: Once executed, the virus will display a "hacked" message and attempt to infect other executables.

## How It Works
1. The virus first reads its own binary code (the executable file).
2. It searches for other `.out` files in the current directory.
3. It overwrites the content of these files with its own code, effectively "infecting" them.
4. After infecting the files, it displays a message: "YOU HAVE BEEN H4CK3D."

> **Note**: This is a simulated project and should only be used for educational purposes to understand how computer viruses might function. Running this on production systems or without proper understanding could result in loss of data or system damage.

## Requirements
- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile the C source code
- A Linux environment for testing (Kali Linux recommended)
  
## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyberblaze-id/Virus-Overwrite.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Virus-Overwrite
```

Compile the source code:

```bash
gcc -g overwrite.c -o overwrite.out
```

## Usage

Run the program by executing the following:

```bash
./overwrite.out
```

The program will read its own binary and attempt to infect other `.out` files in the directory. Make sure to test this in a controlled environment (such as a virtual machine) to avoid any unintended consequences.

## Warning

**This is for educational purposes only!** Do not use this in production environments. It is intended to demonstrate how viruses can spread and replicate themselves. Always exercise caution when dealing with potentially malicious code.
